# Product Vision

## The Problem

Researching the NYC real estate market is time-consuming and fragmented. Brokers, investors, and researchers need access to recent transaction data — mortgages and deeds — but existing sources are either outdated, hard to navigate, or don't support efficient bulk analysis. This slows down deal sourcing, market research, and competitive analysis.

## Our Solution

A platform that aggregates and presents the most recent NYC real estate transactions (mortgages and deeds) with **daily updates** and **powerful bulk search** capabilities.

One sentence: *The fastest way to research NYC real estate transactions at scale.*
